# DownloadBot

Step 1:
  Download and install the latest version of python 3.x ( I insist on the 3rd version, i will not work with python 2.X)<br>
  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">* visit this link to download the python  *</a>
  
Step 2:
  Download the "DownloadBot.py"
  
Step 3:
  Open it with a simple text editor and scroll down, find something like:<br>
  bot = telepot.Bot('__________________TTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNN__________________')<br>
  Replace your TOKEN with __________________TTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNN__________________<br>
  <b>Your TOKEN must be between quotation</b><br>

Step 4:
  Open the Command-Line and change your directory where the "DownloadBot.py" is, and type:
  (unix $ Linux) >> sudo python3 DownloadBot.py
  (Windows)      >> python DownloadBot.py

How to work? just open your telegram app and send your download links to your telegram Bot, the links will be download where you placed "DownloadBot.py" file.
